This code performs inference, learning, and outputs a taxonomy, as described by Bragg, Mausam, and Weld (HCOMP 2013).

The main script run.py accepts a data file as described in preprocess.py.

Dependencies:
- numpy
- scipy


UPDATE:
I am including control.py and util.py to help understand the infogain criterion.I apologize that they are undocumented and don't necessarily integrate well with the rest of the release.
